# Invoice & Notification System

## Overview
The system now includes a fully integrated invoice management system with real-time notifications.

## Invoice Features

### Creating Invoices
1. Navigate to the Admin panel
2. Click "Add Invoice" button
3. Fill in invoice details:
   - Invoice ID (must be unique)
   - Company Name
   - Description (optional)
   - Invoice Date
   - Due Date (optional)
   - Line items with descriptions, quantities, and prices

### Invoice Status Management
- **Pending**: Invoice awaiting payment
- **Paid**: Payment received
- **Overdue**: Past due date without payment

### Error Handling
The invoice system includes comprehensive error handling:
- Duplicate ID validation
- Date validation (due date must be after invoice date)
- Line item validation (quantities, prices, descriptions)
- Permission error detection
- Network error handling

## Notification System

### Automatic Notifications
Notifications are automatically created when:
- A new invoice is created
- An invoice is updated
- An invoice status changes to "Paid"

### Notification Types
1. **Invoice Created**: Medium priority notification when new invoice is saved
2. **Invoice Updated**: Medium priority notification when invoice is modified
3. **Invoice Paid**: High priority notification when invoice status changes to Paid

### Accessing Notifications
1. Navigate to Admin Panel
2. Select "Notification Center" from the sidebar
3. View all notifications with filters:
   - All Notifications
   - Unread Only
   - Task Reminders
   - Service Alerts
   - Battery Warnings
   - Repair Updates
   - Invoice Alerts

### Managing Notifications
- Mark individual notifications as read
- Mark all notifications as read at once
- Delete individual notifications
- Filter by type or read/unread status

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `src/components/admin/CreateInvoice.tsx` - Enhanced error handling and notification integration
- `src/components/admin/NotificationCenter.tsx` - Added invoice notification types
- `src/services/notificationService.ts` - NEW: Service for creating notifications

### Notification Service Usage
```typescript
import { createInvoiceNotification } from '@/services/notificationService';

// Create notification for invoice action
await createInvoiceNotification(
  userId,
  'created', // or 'updated' or 'paid'
  invoiceId,
  companyName
);
```

## Firebase Database Structure

### Invoices Path
```
/invoices/{invoiceId}
  - id: string
  - company_name: string
  - description: string
  - date: number (timestamp)
  - due_date: number | null
  - status: "Pending" | "Paid" | "Overdue"
  - amount: number
  - line_items: array
  - updatedAt: number (timestamp)
```

### Notifications Path
```
/notifications/{userId}/{notificationId}
  - type: string
  - title: string
  - message: string
  - priority: "high" | "medium" | "low"
  - createdAt: number (timestamp)
  - read: boolean
  - hasIndicator: boolean
```

## Testing

## Error Scenarios Handled

1. **Duplicate Invoice ID**: Clear error message asking to use different ID
2. **Invalid Date Range**: Error if due date is before invoice date
3. **Missing Required Fields**: Validation for ID and company name
4. **Line Item Validation**: Ensures descriptions, quantities, and prices are valid
5. **Permission Denied**: Specific error for Firebase permission issues
6. **Network Errors**: Generic fallback with error message display

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for consideration:
- Email notifications for invoice events
- PDF export for invoices
- Bulk invoice operations
- Invoice templates
- Payment tracking integration
- Notification preferences per user
- Push notifications to mobile devices
